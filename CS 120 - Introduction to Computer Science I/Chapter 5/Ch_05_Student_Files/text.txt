The above list formed the basis of our proposed cybersecurity program.
The initial thought was to hire an experienced cybersecurity professional
to develop our program, to hopefully start (with the first three classes)
in the Fall of 2019.   However, we have so far not identified any viable
candidates from the received applications.   We therefore propose to develop
the course in-house, using the course development expertise that Patrick Kopp
and Bill Moran have successfully applied to the many courses in the current
program.   
Looking at the landscape of cybersecurity issues, many of the attacks could
have and should have been prevented.  In most cases, the attacks on individual
and companies were due to a lack of vigilance.  For example, the massive attack
on Experian, that released most of the private data to hackers from millions of
consumers was due to a vulnerability that had been identified, and for which a
patch had been provided by Microsoft a month earlier, but which Experian had
failed to apply.  Had they done so, events may have turned out very differently.
